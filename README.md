## Requirements
- An MPI installation

## Building from source
Customize environment variables in `build.sh`. Generate makefiles and build using CMake by running the script:

```sh
./build.sh
```

## Contents

### Simple OpenMP and MPI demonstration programs (`demo_usage`)
- Demonstrations of point-to-point and collective operations (`demo_usage/mpi_*.c`)

### Dense Linear Algebra function implementations (`dense_algebra`)
- ToDo
